# Kata fizzbuzz
This repository solves FizzBuzz kata as described in [Coding Dojo](https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/) or [Kata-log.rocks](https://kata-log.rocks/fizz-buzz-kata).

The starter level kata is about TDD and baby steps.

## Kata Abstract
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print ‚ÄúFizz‚Äù instead of the number and for the multiples of five print ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print ‚ÄúFizzBuzz ‚Äú.

Sample output
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17

19

... etc up to 100
```


### Stage 2 - new requirements

 * A number is fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
 * A number is buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it
